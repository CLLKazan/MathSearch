Finding Concepts in Mathematical Formulas
-----------------------------------------

Our ontology-based publishing platform [1] annotates mathematical scholarly papers semantically and exposes them as a Linked Data-compliant corpus connected with a few existing LOD data sets including DBpedia. MathSearch enables a particular use case that can be interesting for professional mathematicians as well as graduate students in mathematics - search of named entities in mathematical formulas.
